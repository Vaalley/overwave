## Roadmap / Future Ideas

- [ ] **Map Events:**
  - **The Oasis:** A healing pool spawns randomly. The Hero tries to drink from
    it to heal, forcing the player to defend it.
  - **Sandstorm:** A global weather event that slows down all units (Hero and
    Enemies).
- [ ] **New Units:** Ranged attackers or "suicide bomber" types.
- [ ] **Hero AI 2.0:** Hero builds defenses or seeks specific objectives.
