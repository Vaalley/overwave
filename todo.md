# Overwave Development Plan

## Completed

- [x] **Core Mechanics:** Pivot to "Reverse Survivor" (The Overwave).
- [x] **Hero AI:** Automated "Roomba" movement.
- [x] **Hero AI:** "Coward" behavior (flees from enemies).
- [x] **Hero Combat:** Auto-aim at nearest enemy.
- [x] **Economy:** Mana system with regeneration and spending.
- [x] **Spawning:** Click-to-spawn with Safe Zone protection.
- [x] **Camera:** "God Camera" with WASD movement and Zoom.
- [x] **Win Condition:** Time Limit (Hero Escapes).
- [x] **Loss Condition:** Hero Death (Player Victory).
- [x] **UI:** Basic Mana Bar.
- [x] **UI:** Add the timer display to the HUD.
- [x] **UI:** Create a "Victory/Defeat" end screen (overlay).
- [x] **UI:** Add a Main Menu scene.
- [x] **Units:** Create "Bat" (low cost, high speed, low health).
- [x] **Units:** Create "Cyclop" (high cost, slow speed, high health, high
      damage).
- [x] **Units:** Each unit should have its own damage amount
- [x] Implement UI for selecting units (1, 2, 3 keys implemented, need visual
      icons).
- [x] **Units:** Add unique behaviors/AI for different units? (Bat swoops,
      Cyclop enrages)

## Hero Progression

- [x] Make the Hero collect XP gems.
- [x] Implement "Level Up" logic (Hero gets faster/stronger over time).
- [x] Visual feedback for Hero leveling up.

## Juice & Polish

- [ ] Add Screen Shake on impact/shooting.
- [ ] Add Sound Effects (Spawn, Shoot, Hit, Die).
- [ ] Add Background Music.
- [ ] Add visual spawn effects (poof/particle).

## To be considered in the future

- [ ] A power up system where the player can activate abilities (that have a
      cooldown and a mana cost), for example: "clone" an ability that costs 15
      mana and has a 20 second cooldown but the next unit spawned is actually
      spawned 3 times instead of just one.
